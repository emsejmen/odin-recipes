    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 oz pack of Cool Whip</li>
        <li>4 vanilla pudding cups</li>
        <li>1 box of mini Nilla wafers</li>
        <li>8 oz Philadelphia cream</li>
        <li>3-4 bananas</li>
        <li>1 cup of milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine Cool Whip, pudding cups, and Philadelphia cream. Using a mixer, mix until the ingredients are homogeneous.</li>
        <li>Add milk to a bowl and prepare 4 mason jars for serving. Slice bananas into coin sizes, starting with 2 bananas and slicing more as needed.</li>
        <li>For the first layer, dunk the wafer cookies in the milk for a few seconds and place them on the bottom of the mason jars, just enough to cover it.</li>
        <li>Next, add a layer of the mixture to cover the wafers, followed by a layer of the bananas. Repeat the layers (wafers, mixture, bananas) until the jars are 
            full. Chill in the fridge for a few hours or serve immediately.
