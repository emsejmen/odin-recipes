    <h3>Chicken Egg Rolls</h3>
    <p>This chicken egg roll recipe starts with seasoned ground chicken mixed with sautéed veggies like cabbage and carrots.
        The filling is then rolled into an egg roll wrapper and fried until golden brown, which gives it a satisfying crunch!
        You can dip them in soy sauce or any sauce of your choice.</p>
   
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground chicken</li>
        <li>2 tsp fresh minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tsp ginger powder</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cabbage</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded carrot</li>
        <li>1 package of egg roll wrappers</li>
        <li>3 cups oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a deep pan, heat up the 3 cups of oil for frying until it reaches 375°F.</li>
        <li>In another pan, add a little bit of oil and add chicken, garlic, and ginger. Cook until
